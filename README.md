## Installation
The repository should be cloned into the steam installation folder for Project Cars 2. If you installed in the default location on drive C this would be `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2\` and the complete parth to the files would be `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2\Vehicles\Textures\CustomLiveries\`.

If your file manager prompts you to overwrite existing files you want to say yes, as the default skins are blank white templates and will need to be overwritten. 
## Credits
These car skins were made and by Chris Broomfield, AKA JesusHorsewood and kindly shared.
